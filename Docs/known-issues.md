# Known Issues and Future Improvements

This file tracks MCP tool limitations discovered during development. When encountering issues, document them here.

## Resolved Issues

### `capture_viewport_screenshot` Returned a Stale Frame When the Editor Was Unfocused (Fixed 2026-06-11)
- **Affected**: `projectMCP.capture_viewport_screenshot`
- **Problem**: The capture read the last drawn frame (`GetViewportScreenShot` → `ReadPixels`) without forcing a
  redraw. With the editor window unfocused — the normal state while an MCP agent drives it — the editor throttles
  non-realtime viewport redraws, so `Invalidate()`/`RedrawLevelEditingViewports()` (already called by
  `set_viewport_camera`) only queued a redraw the throttled tick never performed. Consecutive captures returned
  byte-identical stale PNGs despite successful `set_viewport_camera`/`viewmode` changes in between. `HighResShot`
  via console rendered the true state, which confirmed the camera state itself was fine.
- **Fix**: `FViewport::Draw(bShouldPresent=true)` + `FlushRenderingCommands()` synchronously in the capture
  command, right before reading pixels — bypasses the editor-tick throttle. The Python tool schema is unchanged;
  the docstring now documents the fresh-frame guarantee.
- **Verification**: With the editor unfocused: camera A (top-down) → capture, camera B (ground horizon) →
  capture. Each PNG must differ and show its own camera state (previously consecutive captures were
  byte-identical). Verified live 2026-06-11 on SimPrototype's Lvl_TopDown.
- **No automation test**: the repro depends on the window focus/throttle state, which an in-editor automation run
  cannot control deterministically (a focused session redraws normally and the bug never manifests). Covered by
  the live MCP verification protocol above.

### `execute_console_command` Ignored the Active PIE World (Fixed 2026-06-10)
- **Affected**: `editorMCP.execute_console_command`
- **Problem**: The C++ command always executed through `GEditor->GetEditorWorldContext()`. During PIE, runtime
  commands such as world regeneration changed the editor world while the visible PIE session remained unchanged.
- **Fix**: Prefer `GEditor->GetPIEWorldContext()->World()` while PIE is active, with the editor world as the
  fallback outside play sessions. The Python tool schema is unchanged.
- **Verification**: Execute a world-specific console command during PIE and confirm its runtime log/HUD state
  changes in the PIE world; stop PIE and confirm the same tool still executes against the editor world.

### `set_viewport_camera` Ignored the Active PIE Camera (Fixed 2026-06-10)
- **Affected**: `editorMCP.set_viewport_camera`
- **Problem**: The command only moved the editor viewport. During PIE, captures stayed on the gameplay pawn camera,
  so project-specific camera and spring-arm behavior ignored the requested transform.
- **Fix**: In PIE, create or reuse a transient `ACameraActor`, apply the requested transform/FOV, and make it the
  local player's view target. Outside PIE, retain the editor viewport behavior. The Python tool schema is unchanged.
- **Verification**: Capture the same PIE target from distinct camera transforms and confirm the images change
  accordingly.

## Active Issues

### `viewmode` Console Commands Don't Reach the Editor Viewport
- **Affected**: `editorMCP.execute_console_command` with `viewmode unlit` / `viewmode wireframe` / etc.
- **Problem**: The command executes successfully but the level-editor viewport keeps its current view mode —
  the exec path doesn't route to the `FEditorViewportClient` the way the in-viewport console does. Confirmed
  2026-06-11 (both via capture_viewport_screenshot after the stale-frame fix AND via `HighResShot`, so it is
  not a stale-frame symptom — the viewport genuinely never switches).
- **Workaround**: none via MCP today; change the view mode by hand in the viewport toolbar.
- **Fix candidate**: a dedicated `set_viewport_viewmode` tool (or special-casing in execute_console_command)
  calling `FEditorViewportClient::SetViewMode(VMI_*)` on the active perspective viewport.

### MCP TCP Connection Freezes (Mitigated 2026-05-31)
- **Affected**: All MCP servers communicating via TCP port 55558
- **Previous Problem**: After long sessions, MCP tools could hang silently with no error returned to Cursor. Causes included:
  - C++ server logging parse errors but never sending a response (client/server deadlock)
  - `Future.Get()` blocking the server thread indefinitely when the game thread was stalled (modal dialogs, heavy compiles)
  - Python async clients using `reader.read(49152)` with no timeout
  - Single 8192-byte `Recv()` truncating large command payloads
- **Fix Applied**:
  - C++ server always returns JSON (success or error) and uses one-shot request/response per connection
  - Multi-chunk JSON read on C++ (up to 256 KB commands) and Python (up to 4 MB responses)
  - 120s command timeout on C++ `ExecuteCommand`; 130s timeout on Python clients
  - Shared async TCP utility: `Python/utils/async_tcp_utils.py`
- **120s Timeout Policy**: Commands exceeding 120 seconds return a timeout error instead of freezing MCP. Heavy operations (large Blueprint/Niagara compiles) may hit this limit — split work into smaller steps or compile manually in the editor.
- **Recovery if timeout occurs**:
  1. Check UE Output Log for `"Command timed out"` or stuck `"Executing command"`
  2. Look for hidden modal dialogs in the editor (save prompts, Material/Niagara editor dialogs)
  3. Restart Unreal Editor if the server thread remains wedged
  4. Restart Python MCP servers in Cursor after UE restart
- **Known Limitation**: A timed-out command may still complete on the game thread later (AsyncTask is not cancelled). The timeout unblocks the server thread so other MCP calls can proceed.
- **Debug TCP logging**: Set `UNREAL_MCP_TCP_DEBUG=1` to enable `Python/tcp_debug.log` (disabled by default to avoid unbounded file growth).

### Material-Output Property List Is Duplicated Across 4 Files (Refactor Candidate)
- **Affected**: `connect_expression_to_material_output`, `get_material_expression_metadata`, `compile_material`, `delete_material_expression`
- **Problem**: The set of supported `EMaterialProperty` outputs is hand-maintained as **7 separate hard-coded lists** across 4 files:
  - `MaterialExpressionCore.cpp` — `GetMaterialPropertyFromString` (string→enum for connect)
  - `MaterialExpressionConnection.cpp` — `NameToMaterialPropertyStrict` (SetMaterialAttributes pins)
  - `MaterialExpressionMetadata.cpp` — `AddOutputIfConnected` (material_outputs), orphan `CheckMaterialOutput`, `TraceFlow`
  - `MaterialExpressionManagement.cpp` — `DisconnectFromOutput` (delete path), orphan `CheckMaterialOutput` (compile)
- **Impact**: Adding a new output (e.g. Displacement in UE 5.7) requires touching all 7 or things silently break — a node wired to a missing output is mis-flagged as an orphan (`compile_material`), invisible in `material_outputs`, or left dangling on delete. The lists are also already inconsistent (`DisconnectFromOutput` omits Refraction/SubsurfaceColor that the others include).
- **Fix (deferred)**: Extract one shared `static const TArray<TPair<EMaterialProperty, FString>>` (or iterate the engine's `FMaterialAttributeDefinitionMap`) and drive all sites from it.
- **Workaround**: When adding an output, grep `MP_AmbientOcclusion` as a sentinel — every match needs the new property added beside it.

### Struct Field GUID Middle Numbers Can Change When Structs Are Modified
- **Affected**: `get_struct_pin_names`, `get_datatable_row_names`, DataTable operations
- **Problem**: User-defined structs use GUID-based internal field names (e.g., `TestField1_2_1EAE0B8A4B971533B2AD21BF45BA9220`). The hex suffix (GUID) remains stable, but the middle number can change when the struct is modified (type changes, field additions/removals).
- **Example**: After modifying `S_TestGUID` struct:
  - Before: `TestField1_2_1EAE0B8A4B971533B2AD21BF45BA9220`
  - After:  `TestField1_5_1EAE0B8A4B971533B2AD21BF45BA9220`
  - Note: `_2_` changed to `_5_`, but hex GUID suffix stayed same
- **Impact**: Cached field names may become stale after struct modifications
- **Workaround**: Always fetch fresh pin names using `get_struct_pin_names` or `get_datatable_row_names` before any struct field operations. Never hardcode GUID-based field names.

### Pure Functions Cannot Use Loop Accumulation Pattern
- **Affected**: Blueprint functions marked as `is_pure=True` that need to accumulate values in loops
- **Problem**: Pure functions in Blueprint cannot have execution flow (no exec pins), but For Each Loop macro requires execution pins for the loop body. This makes accumulating values (like summing StackCount across matching slots) impossible in a pure function.
- **Example**: `GetTotalItemCount` was designed as pure but needs to sum values across loop iterations
- **Workaround**: Make such functions impure (`is_pure=False`) instead. The function will still work correctly, just won't be callable from pure contexts.

### Graph Nodes Metadata Response Size
- **Affected**: `get_blueprint_metadata` with `fields=["graph_nodes"]`
- **Status**: Mitigated with ultra-compact format
- **New format**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "ABC123",
    "title": "Branch",
    "pins": {
      "Condition": ["DEF456|Get IsInventoryOpen|ReturnValue"],
      "True": ["GHI789|Remove from Parent|execute"],
      "False": ["JKL012|Create Widget|execute"],
      "InputPin": "default_value_here"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Format details**:
  - Each node has: `id`, `title`, `pins` (object)
  - Connected pins: `"pinName": ["nodeId|nodeTitle|targetPin", ...]`
  - Unconnected input pins with defaults: `"pinName": "defaultValue"`
  - Unconnected pins without defaults: omitted entirely
  - Removed: `type`, `x`, `y`, `dir`, pin type info
- **Orphaned nodes format**: `id`, `title`, `graph` only (no type, x, y)
- **Best practices**:
  - Design smaller, focused functions (15-20 nodes max)
  - Use `node_type` filter to reduce response size
  - Always specify `graph_name` parameter to limit scope

### No MCP Tool to Remove Widget Components
- **Affected**: `mcp__umgMCP` tools
- **Problem**: While we can add components to UMG Widget Blueprints using `add_widget_component_to_widget`, there is no corresponding tool to remove/delete widget components.
- **Example**: After refactoring WBP_InventoryGrid from ScrollBox+VerticalBox to UniformGridPanel, the old components (SlotsScrollBox, SlotsContainer) remain in the widget.
- **Impact**: Old unused components clutter the widget hierarchy but don't affect functionality if not referenced in logic.
- **Workaround**: Leave unused components in place (they won't affect runtime if not connected), or manually remove them in Unreal Editor.
- **Future Fix**: Implement `remove_widget_component` tool in umgMCP.

### Cast Nodes Require Execution Pin Connections (CRITICAL - RECURRING ISSUE)
- **Affected**: `K2Node_DynamicCast` nodes created via `create_node_by_action_name`
- **Problem**: Cast nodes (e.g., "Cast To PlayerController", "Cast To Widget") have BOTH execution pins AND data pins. Simply connecting data pins (Object input, cast output) is NOT sufficient - the execution pins MUST also be connected for the cast to actually execute.
- **Root Cause of Recurring Mistakes**: Unlike most programming languages where casts are pure expressions, Unreal Blueprint Cast nodes are **IMPURE** - they require being in the execution chain to run.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Blueprint compiles with warnings: "Cast To X was pruned because its Exec pin is not connected"
  - Cast output pin returns null at runtime even though input is valid
  - Downstream nodes that depend on cast result fail silently
- **MANDATORY WORKFLOW when using Cast nodes**:
  1. Create the Cast node
  2. Connect BOTH execution pins (execute input AND then output) into the execution chain
  3. THEN connect data pins (Object input, cast result output)
  4. If you need the cast result but don't want execution flow to go through it - YOU CANNOT USE A CAST NODE. Consider alternatives:
     - Store the already-typed reference in a variable
     - Use interface calls instead of casting
     - Restructure logic so cast is in the main execution path
- **Example**:
  ```
  WRONG:  GetController --[Return Value]--> Cast To PlayerController --[As PlayerController]--> SetInputMode
  RIGHT:  GetController --[exec]--> Cast To PlayerController --[exec]--> SetInputMode
                        --[Return Value]-->                  --[As PlayerController]-->
  ```
- **Workaround**: Always connect BOTH execution flow AND data flow through cast nodes. The cast node must be in the execution chain, not just receiving data.

### NiagaraMCP compile_niagara_asset Returns Warnings as Errors
- **Affected**: `compile_niagara_asset` in niagaraMCP
- **Date Discovered**: 2026-01-06
- **Problem**: Compile returns `status: "error"` for non-fatal warnings
- **Example Request**:
  ```json
  {"asset_path": "/Game/VFX/NS_RealisticFire"}
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "error",
    "error": "[FireEmbers] Spawn Script: Default found for InitializeParticle.Material Random, but not found in ParameterMap traversal - Node: Map Get - ..."
  }
  ```
- **Actual Behavior**: System compiles and works fine - these are warnings about default values
- **Impact**: AI incorrectly interprets successful compiles as failures
- **Suggested Fix**: Distinguish warnings from errors:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "warnings": ["..."],
    "errors": []
  }
  ```

---

### MaterialMCP compile_material Doesn't Report All Shader Compilation Errors
- **Affected**: `compile_material` in materialMCP
- **Date Discovered**: 2026-01-11
- **Problem**: `compile_material` returns `success: true` with empty `compile_errors` array even when shader compilation fails
- **Example**: Noise expression with 2D input (TexCoord) instead of required 3D input causes shader error, but MCP reports success
- **Actual Error** (visible in UE Output Log):
  ```
  [SM6] Shader debug info dumped to: "E:\code\unreal-mcp\MCPGameProject\Saved\ShaderDebugInfo\PCD3D_SM6\M_Ember_..."
  C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Shaders\Private\MaterialTemplate.ush(4567,18):
  Shader FLumenCardPS, Permutation 0, VF FLocalVertexFactory:
  /Engine/Generated/Material.ush:4567:18: error: no matching function for call to 'MaterialExpressionNoise'
  float Local11 = MaterialExpressionNoise( Local10 ,8.00000000f,1.00000000f,0.00000000f,...);
  ```
- **MCP Response** (incorrect):
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "compile_errors": [],
    "has_compile_errors": false
  }
  ```
- **Impact**: AI thinks material compiled successfully when it actually has broken shaders
- **Root Cause**: MCP tool likely only checks `UMaterial::GetCompileErrors()` which returns expression-level errors, not shader compilation errors from the HLSL compiler
- **Workaround**: Always visually verify material preview in Unreal Editor after compile; check Output Log for shader errors
- **Suggested Fix**: Capture shader compilation errors from `FMaterialResource::GetCompileErrors()` or hook into shader compilation result callbacks

## Resolved Issues

- **ProjectMCP set_object_property Silently Failed on Object-Array Properties (e.g. UVoxelMegaMaterial.SurfaceTypes)** - Resolved 2026-06-11
  - Issue (2026-06-04): setting `MM_Landscape.SurfaceTypes` (`TArray<UVoxelSurfaceTypeAsset*>` on a `UVoxelMegaMaterial`) returned `success: true` but the array stayed at the original 6 elements after a cache-delete + editor relaunch.
  - Root cause (reconstructed): NOT the array import — the command's tail saved via `UEditorAssetLibrary::SaveAsset(RAW asset path)`. With a package-form path that save silently no-ops (the same object-path-vs-package-path resolution bug as the create_data_asset persist issue above, fixed 2026-06-07). The import succeeded in memory, the save never hit disk, and the relaunch-based verification flow lost the change. The save now uses the normalized OBJECT path.
  - Verified live 2026-06-11 (UE 5.7, SimPrototype): a 7-element `SurfaceTypes` write (6 biomes + ST_CaveWall) onto a `MM_Landscape` duplicate applies all 7 (re-exported value confirms, incl. after `PostEditChangeProperty`) and persists to disk immediately.
  - Hardening (2026-06-11), because the old lesson was "do not trust the success flag":
    - every `set_object_property` response now carries **`applied_value`** — the property RE-EXPORTED from the asset after import + PostEditChangeProperty (what will actually persist); compare it against intent instead of trusting `success`;
    - **unresolvable object references are now an error**: UE's ImportText imports an unloadable object path as `None` WITHOUT a parser error (verified live: a bogus array element produced `(None)` + `success: true`). For object-ref properties/arrays/sets a `None` token the caller did not explicitly write is rejected and the previous value is **rolled back**; explicit `None` in the input keeps working.
  - Historical note: the original OPEN entry suspected `PropertyServiceArrayOps::SetArrayPropertyFromJson` — that path is unrelated; this command imports via `FProjectDataAssetService::SetObjectProperty` → `ImportText_Direct`.

- **ProjectMCP create_data_asset / create_asset Don't Persist to Disk; properties dropped; save_asset rejects package path** - Fixed 2026-06-07
  - Issue: `create_data_asset` returned `success` but the `.uasset` was never written to disk (lived in memory only → lost on editor close, uncommittable). Passing a `properties` map silently dropped ALL properties (asset saved with class defaults). `save_asset("/Game/Foo/Bar")` (package path) returned "Asset does not exist", though `save_asset("/Game/Foo/Bar.Bar")` (object path) worked. `create_asset` shared the persist bug.
  - Root Cause: `FProjectDataAssetService::CreateDataAsset`/`CreateAsset` persisted via `UEditorAssetLibrary::SaveAsset(PackageName, ...)`, which forwards to `UEditorAssetSubsystem` and resolves the path through the asset registry. The registry keys on the OBJECT path (`/Game/X.X`); a brand-new in-memory asset does NOT resolve by its bare PACKAGE path (`/Game/X`), so the save silently no-ops — and `CreateDataAsset` didn't even check the return (false success). The properties loop called `SetDataAssetProperty`, which `StaticLoadObject`s the not-yet-saved asset → null → properties dropped. `FProjectAssetOperations::SaveAsset` gated on `DoesAssetExist(rawPath)` without the object-path normalization that `RenameAsset`/`MoveAsset` already use. (Same class of bug as the 2026-01-11 MaterialMCP persist fix below.)
  - Fix (`ProjectDataAssetService.cpp` + `ProjectAssetOperations.cpp`):
    - `CreateDataAsset`/`CreateAsset` → explicit, checked `UPackage::SavePackage()` on the in-hand `UPackage*` (no registry path dependency; mirrors `MaterialService.cpp`). On failure: roll back via `FAssetRegistryModule::AssetDeleted` + `ClearFlags(RF_Public|RF_Standalone)` and return a real error (no more silent success).
    - Properties now applied directly on the in-hand new object via a shared `ProjectDataAssetServiceHelpers::ApplyJsonProperty` helper (also used by `SetDataAssetProperty`) — no `StaticLoadObject` during creation.
    - `FProjectAssetOperations::SaveAsset` normalizes package→object path before `DoesAssetExist`/`SaveAsset` (mirrors `RenameAsset`/`MoveAsset`). `SetDataAssetProperty`/`SetObjectProperty` saves likewise use the normalized path.
  - C++ only (no Python change). **Verified live** (rebuilt DLL, SimPrototype editor): `create_data_asset(ColonyConfig, properties {MinNavigableLevel:-7, MaxNavigableLevel:9})` → `.uasset` on disk (no separate save) with the correct NON-default values; `save_asset("/Game/Test/DA_McpPersistTest")` (package path) succeeds; `create_asset(/Script/SimPrototype.ColonyConfig)` → on disk; abstract-class create correctly refused.

- **MaterialMCP create_material_instance Crashes Python with `name 'json' is not defined`** - Fixed 2026-06-04
  - Issue: `create_material_instance` (and the batch param tools) called `json.dumps(...)` when a `scalar_params`/`vector_params`/`texture_params` dict was passed, but `Python/material_mcp_server.py` never imported `json` → `NameError`, before the TCP command was even sent.
  - Fix: Added `import json` at the top of `material_mcp_server.py`. (Python-only — needs a material MCP server restart to take effect.)
  - Verified live: `create_material_instance(..., vector_params={...})` succeeds.

- **MaterialMCP set_material_expression_property Silently Stores (0,0,0,0) for FLinearColor `"(R=..,G=..,B=..,A=..)"` DefaultValue** - Fixed 2026-06-04
  - Issue: Setting a `VectorParameter` (or `Constant3Vector`/`Constant4Vector`) `DefaultValue`/`Constant` to the UE ImportText form `"(R=1,G=1,B=1,A=1)"` returned `success: true` but stored `(0,0,0,0)` — `ParseIntoArray(",")` produced tokens like `"(R=1"` and `FCString::Atof("(R=1")` returns `0.0`.
  - Real-world impact: greyed an entire voxel terrain (a shared master's `Tint` defaulted to black, multiplying all biome albedo to 0).
  - Fix: Added `TryParseLinearColorString()` in `MaterialExpressionCreation.cpp` accepting BOTH `"(R=..)"` (`FLinearColor::InitFromString`) and `"R,G,B[,A]"`, returning an ERROR (not silent success) when neither parses. Applied to `VectorParameter`, `Constant3Vector`, `Constant4Vector`.
  - Verified live: `"(R=0.5,G=0.6,B=0.7,A=1.0)"` → `[0.5,0.6,0.7,1.0]`; `"notacolor"` → error; `"0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4"` → `[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4]`.

- **NiagaraMCP get_module_inputs Cannot Read Default UniformRanged Dynamic Input Min/Max Values** - Fixed 2026-01-17
  - Issue: When a module input uses an UniformRanged dynamic input with default/unmodified values (e.g., systems created in Unreal Editor using stock dynamic inputs), the min/max values could not be read because they were baked into the dynamic input script asset.
  - Root Cause: Unreal stores dynamic input values in multiple locations:
    1. Override pins (created when user modifies defaults)
    2. RapidIterationParameters (alternative storage)
    3. Script asset defaults (baked into the dynamic input script graph)
    - Previous implementation only read from locations 1 and 2, missing location 3.
  - Fix: Added APPROACH 4 in `ExtractUniformRangedValues()` that loads the dynamic input script's graph via `DynamicInputNode->FunctionScript->GetLatestSource()` and reads the `UNiagaraScriptVariable` default values for "Minimum" and "Maximum" parameters using `GetDefaultValueData()`.
  - Now `get_module_inputs` returns `random_min` and `random_max` for ALL UniformRanged dynamic inputs, including those with stock/default values.

- **MaterialMCP Created Assets Don't Persist to Disk** - Fixed 2026-01-11
  - Issue: Materials created via `create_material` existed in memory but weren't saved to disk. "Save All" didn't persist them.
  - Root Cause: `CreateMaterial()`, `CreateMaterialInstance()`, and `DuplicateMaterialInstance()` only called `MarkPackageDirty()` but never actually saved the package to disk
  - Fix: Added explicit `UPackage::SavePackage()` calls after asset creation in MaterialService.cpp
  - Note: NiagaraMCP already had proper `SaveAsset()` calls - this was MaterialMCP-specific

- **MaterialMCP Several Expression Types Not Recognized (Noise, ParticleRandom, Length)** - Fixed 2026-01-11
  - Issue: Expression types `Noise`, `ParticleRandom`, and `Length` returned "Unknown expression type" errors
  - Root Cause: These expression classes were not mapped in `GetExpressionClassFromTypeName()`
  - Fix: Added includes for `MaterialExpressionNoise.h`, `MaterialExpressionParticleRandom.h`, `MaterialExpressionLength.h` and registered them in the expression type map
  - Noise expression now supports all configurable properties: Scale, Quality, Levels, OutputMin, OutputMax, LevelScale, Turbulence, Tiling, RepeatSize, NoiseFunction (enum 0-5)

- **MaterialMCP ComponentMask Channel Configuration Not Supported** - Fixed 2026-01-11
  - Issue: ComponentMask R/G/B/A channel selection wasn't working, causing "component mask 0000" compile errors
  - Root Cause: Was actually working - the issue was in how properties were being passed from Python side
  - Verification: Tested with `{"R": true, "G": false, "B": false, "A": false}` - material compiles successfully

- **MaterialMCP RadialGradientExponential Expression Not Supported** - Fixed 2026-01-09
  - Issue: Expression type "RadialGradientExponential" was not recognized
  - Root Cause: RadialGradientExponential is NOT a native expression - it's a Material Function at `/Engine/Functions/Engine_MaterialFunctions01/Gradient/RadialGradientExponential`
  - Fix: Added `MaterialFunctionCall` expression type support. Now any Material Function can be used:
    ```python
    add_material_expression(
        material_path="/Game/Materials/M_Ember",
        expression_type="MaterialFunctionCall",
        properties={"function": "/Engine/Functions/Engine_MaterialFunctions01/Gradient/RadialGradientExponential"}
    )
    ```
  - Also added `FunctionCall` alias for convenience

- **MaterialMCP ScalarParameter DefaultValue Not Applied** - Fixed 2026-01-09
  - Issue: `DefaultValue` property for ScalarParameter expressions not applied when specified in properties dict
  - Root Cause: Property name case sensitivity - C++ checked for `default_value` (lowercase) but Python sent `DefaultValue` (camelCase)
  - Fix: Now accepts both camelCase and lowercase property names in MaterialExpressionCreation.cpp

- **NiagaraMCP Cannot Set Curve/Gradient Values Over Particle Lifetime** - Fixed 2026-01-09
  - Issue: Cannot set values that change over particle lifetime (fade out, color changes, size curves)
  - Fix: Added `set_module_curve_input` and `set_module_color_curve_input` commands with keyframe support
  - For LinearColor inputs, uses Dynamic Inputs (e.g., "Scale Linear Color by Curve") to wrap curve sampling

- **NiagaraMCP Cannot Set Random Range Values** - Fixed 2026-01-09
  - Issue: Cannot set randomized inputs - particles all had identical values
  - Fix: Added `set_module_random_input` MCP tool that attaches UniformRangedFloat/Vector/Color dynamic input scripts
  - Supports Float, Int, Vector2D, Vector3, Vector4, and LinearColor types

- **NiagaraMCP Module Search Returns Empty for Multi-Word Queries** - Fixed 2026-01-09
  - Issue: `search_niagara_modules("Scale Sprite")` returned 0 results, but single words worked
  - Root Cause: Search used exact substring match for entire query including spaces
  - Fix: Split query into words and match ALL words independently (AND logic)
  - Now `"Scale Sprite"` → 3 results, `"Curl Noise"` → 5 results

- **NiagaraMCP LinearColor Type Cannot Be Set via set_module_input** - Fixed 2026-01-09
  - Issue: Setting LinearColor parameters returned success but value didn't change
  - Root Cause: Was likely a format issue - the original tests used `(R=1.0, G=0.7, B=0.2, A=1.0)` format
  - Fix: Use comma-separated format `1.0,0.5,0.0,1.0` with `value_type="color"`
  - Verified working on Color module in Update stage

- **NiagaraMCP Module Input Type Discovery Missing** - Fixed 2026-01-09
  - Issue: No way to know what type a module input expects before setting it
  - Fix: Added `get_module_inputs` tool that returns input names, types, and current values
  - Example: `get_module_inputs(system, emitter, "Color", "Update")` returns `[{name: "Color", type: "LinearColor"}, ...]`

- **NiagaraMCP add_emitter_to_system create_if_missing Returns Unknown Error** - Fixed 2026-01-09
  - Issue: `create_if_missing=True` always returned "Unknown error" even when emitter creation succeeded
  - Root Cause: MCP framework wraps responses as `{"status": "success", "result": {...}}` but Python code checked for `success` at top level
  - Fix: Updated Python to unwrap MCP response format and check `result.success` or `status == "success"`

- **NiagaraMCP set_module_color_curve_input Cannot Set Curves on LinearColor Inputs** - Fixed 2026-01-09
  - Issue: ColorCurve data interfaces cannot be directly assigned to LinearColor inputs (type incompatibility). This caused crashes when viewing the module in Niagara Editor.
  - Root Cause: LinearColor inputs expect LinearColor values, not ColorCurve DIs. The ColorCurve DI's `SampleColorCurve(float)` function outputs LinearColor, but requires a Dynamic Input wrapper to bind properly.
  - Fix: Implemented two-approach system in `NiagaraCurveInputService::SetModuleColorCurveInput()`:
    1. **For LinearColor inputs**: Uses `FNiagaraStackGraphUtilities::SetDynamicInputForFunctionInput()` to attach a Dynamic Input script (e.g., "Scale Linear Color by Curve") that wraps the curve sampling
    2. **For explicit curve inputs**: Direct ColorCurve DI assignment (original logic)
  - Added helper functions: `FindDynamicInputScriptForType()` to find suitable Dynamic Input scripts, and `FindAndConfigureColorCurveOnDynamicInput()` to configure the curve on nested inputs
  - Now properly creates color gradients on Color module inputs, displaying as "Scale Linear Color by Curve" in the editor

- **NiagaraMCP set_emitter_enabled Command Not Implemented** - Fixed 2026-01-08
  - Issue: Python wrapper existed but C++ command handler was missing
  - Error: `{"status": "error", "error": "Unknown command: set_emitter_enabled"}`
  - Fix: Implemented `FSetEmitterEnabledCommand` and `FNiagaraService::SetEmitterEnabled()` using `FNiagaraEmitterHandle::SetIsEnabled()`
  - Now supports enabling/disabling emitters within Niagara systems

- **NiagaraMCP remove_emitter_from_system Command Missing** - Fixed 2026-01-08
  - Issue: No command existed to remove emitters from a Niagara system
  - Error: `{"status": "error", "error": "Unknown command: remove_emitter_from_system"}`
  - Fix: Implemented `FRemoveEmitterFromSystemCommand` and `FNiagaraService::RemoveEmitterFromSystem()` using `UNiagaraSystem::RemoveEmitterHandle()`
  - Now supports removing emitters from systems programmatically

- **NiagaraMCP set_renderer_property Enum Properties Not Supported** - Fixed in NiagaraService.cpp
  - Issue: Enum properties like `Alignment`, `FacingMode`, `SortMode` on sprite renderers couldn't be set
  - Fix: Added `FEnumProperty` and `FByteProperty` handling to `SetRendererProperty()`
  - Now supports all enum properties with helpful error messages listing valid values
  - Example: `set_renderer_property(..., "Alignment", "VelocityAligned")` now works

- **MaterialMCP Missing Expression Types for Particle/VFX** - Fixed in MaterialExpressionService.cpp
  - Added: `ParticleColor`, `VertexColor`, `SphereMask`, `Dot`/`DotProduct`, `Distance`, `Normalize`, `Saturate`, `Sqrt`/`SquareRoot`, `TextureCoordinate`
  - Enables creation of proper particle materials that read Niagara color/alpha attributes

- **MaterialMCP Operations Trigger "Apply Changes" Dialog** - Fixed in MaterialExpressionService.cpp
  - Issue: Multiple operations triggered Material Editor's "apply changes?" dialog when editor was open, blocking MCP
  - Fix: Added PreEditChange/PostEditChange + MarkPackageDirty before CloseAllEditorsForAsset() in all 5 locations
  - Affected functions: ConnectExpressions, ConnectExpressionsBatch, ConnectToMaterialOutput, DeleteExpression, SetExpressionProperty

- **Material Expression Connections Return Success But Don't Persist** - Fixed in MaterialExpressionService.cpp
  - Issue: `connect_material_expressions` returned `success: true` but connections were lost after reopening the material.
  - Root Cause: Code was using graph-level connections (`MakeLinkTo()`, `TryCreateConnection()`) and syncing in wrong direction (`LinkMaterialExpressionsFromGraph()`). MaterialGraph is transient - rebuilt from expressions on load.
  - Fix: Use UE5's `ConnectExpression()` method and sync graph FROM expressions:
    ```cpp
    SourceExpr->ConnectExpression(TargetInput, Params.SourceOutputIndex);
    Material->MaterialGraph->LinkGraphNodesFromMaterial();  // Expressions → Graph
    ```
  - Key insight: `LinkGraphNodesFromMaterial()` = Expressions → Graph (CORRECT). `LinkMaterialExpressionsFromGraph()` = Graph → Expressions (UNRELIABLE for persistence).

- **NiagaraMCP set_module_input + add_module_to_emitter Combination Causes Compilation Errors** - Fixed in NiagaraModuleService.cpp
  - Issue: Using both tools together caused "ParameterMap traversal" compilation errors
  - Root Cause: `set_module_input` was setting rapid iteration parameters on only ONE script, but Niagara expects them on ALL affected scripts (system spawn/update + emitter scripts)
  - Fix: Implemented equivalent of `FNiagaraStackGraphUtilities::FindAffectedScripts()` (not exported) to collect all affected scripts, then set rapid iteration parameter on ALL of them
  - Now `set_module_input` and `add_module_to_emitter` can be used together without corruption

- **MaterialMCP set_material_expression_property Crashes When Setting DefaultValue on ScalarParameter** - Fixed in MaterialExpressionCreation.cpp
  - Issue: `set_material_expression_property` with `property_name="DefaultValue"` on a ScalarParameter crashed Unreal Editor
  - Error: `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION reading address 0x0000000000000000`
  - Root Cause: The code was calling `PostEditChangeProperty()` on the expression, which triggers `UMaterialExpressionScalarParameter::PostEditChangeProperty()`. This broadcasts `FEditorSupportDelegates::NumericParameterDefaultChanged` delegate, which expects `Expression->Material` to be valid. However, expressions added via `EditorData->ExpressionCollection.AddExpression()` don't have their `Material` member set (only the UObject Outer is set).
  - Fix: Removed the `PreEditChange`/`PostEditChangeProperty` pattern for ScalarParameter and VectorParameter DefaultValue changes. Since `RecompileMaterial()` is called later anyway, these notifications were redundant. Now values are set directly:
    ```cpp
    ScalarParam->DefaultValue = NewValue;  // Direct assignment, no PostEditChangeProperty
    ```
  - Also applies to VectorParameter DefaultValue for consistency
